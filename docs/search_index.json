At the very beginning, we find that the pandemic only exists in NY state (with few cases in other states). As time goes on, the covid-19 cases spread rapidly through CA, TX and FL from June. From the nine plots above, it seems that the number of total cases in the east coast is higher than the one in the west and middle. 5.1.2 New cases in US The plots above show the trend of increased cases in US from March to November. In March, the break-out of covid-19 occurred in NY and surrounding areas. After that, the second phrase of break-out occurred in CA, TX, FL and NY in July. After that, the cases of IL and the nearby regions also increased rapidly. 5.1.3 Monthly new cases (in thousands) by States This parallel coordinate plot captures monthly total new cases from March to November by States. Observing the outliers of each month, we could conclude that The situations of NY and NJ were most sever at the beginning of the epidemic, but the new cases were reduced a lot after May. From June to November, most new cases were confirmed in TX, FL and CA. The number of monthly new cases in IL has two obvious peaks in May and November respectively. 5.1.4 New case / Total case by States 5.2 How does medical resources affect Covid19 death rate? 5.2.1 Death rate and Hospital admission rate This line chart displays average death rate and hospital admission rate of Covid19 patients in the US. Because the hospital admission data before 2020-07-26 is missing, time of this plot starts from 2020-07-26. From the plot, we can see that overall hospital admission rate increased from 2020-09-28, and death rate not only decreased but also decreased faster. There are a lot of factors affect death rate, this plot shows that hospital admission rate is one of the factors. And this inspired us to explore the relationship between hospital admission rate and the change rate of death rate. 5.2.2 Decrease rate of death-rate and Hospital admission rate This is a smoothed plot of decrease rate of death rate and hospital admission rate. The pattern is very clear that when hospital admission rate decreases, death rate decreases slower. And when hospital admission rate increases, death rate decreases faster. We can conclude that enlarging the hospital capacity and receiving more Covid19 patients could speed up the death rate decreasing. 5.2.3 Death rate and Inpatient bed availability This is a heatmap for available impatient beds and death rate. Because there is a delay for reporting death and death rate is more likely relating to number of available bed before death, we use the 7 days average value to see the relationship. It shows in the heapmap that Data with death rate higher than 10% has number of available inpatient beds less than 5000. When there are more than 15000 available inpatient beds, the death rate is below 5%. 5.2.4 Death rate and inpatient beds availability by States From this dot plot, we can clearly see that hospitals in most of the states increased inpatient beds. Compare to other states, FL, CA, TX and NY prepared more beds for Covid patient. 5.2.5 Comparison between adult and pediatric patient over time 5.3 Does Covid19 impact differently on adult and pediatric patient? 5.3.1 Comparison between adult and pediatric patient over time Month stat number 04 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 2 04 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 05 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5 05 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 06 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5 06 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 07 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 9779 07 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 73 08 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 8853 08 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 60 09 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 4263 09 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 44 10 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5759 10 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 44 11 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 7146 11 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 74 "]]
