They are COVID-19 cases and deaths by States over time (Cases_and_Deaths) and COVID-19 patient impact and hospital capacity by State over time (Hospital_Utilization). We would combine two datasets for our use. Cases_and_Deaths has 18000 observations by 60 States from 2020-01-22 to 2020-11-16. Hospital_Utilization has 14003 observations by 53 States from 2020-01-01 to 2020-11-15. ## [1] &quot;Number of States in Cases_and_Deaths is 60.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Cases_and_Deaths records data from 2020-01-22 to 2020-11-16.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Number of States in Hospital_Utilization is 53.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Hospital_Utilization records data from 2020-01-01 to 2020-11-15.&quot; Two datasets are inconsistent in Date and States. To join them together, We chose the starting date at when the pandemic broke out (when total cases in US exceeded 100). And only focused on 50 States in “state” package. Covid19_df is the merged dataframe. ## [1] &quot;Covid-19 broke out among US at 2020-03-05.&quot; There are many useless variables for our analysis. We would drop all redundant variables. Covid19_selected_df is the dateframe we would use in analysis.

This number only accounts for hospitals in the state that report both “staffed_adult_icu_bed_occupancy” and “total_staffed_adult_icu_beds” fields. The data is not 100% accurate. Since COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Percentage data 3.2 Nationwide data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Percentage data To investigate the trend in each state, it is necessary to study the change in the percentage of bed occupations and confired/suspected cases besides comparing the real numbers. Therefore, we transform the values of some columns into percentage. 3.1.1 Increase in covid-19 cases The relationship between the covid-19 cases and hospital utilization might be highly related. We are interested in how many of the suspected/confirmed cases are in each state. Therefore, we would transform the counts of newly increased cases into the percentage of admitted covid-19 cases among the total cases in each state. Raw values: tot_cases: [int] new_case: [int] tot_death: [int] new_death: [int] Transformed values: new_case_P: [float] new_case / tot_cases tot_death_P: [int] tot_death / tot_cases new_death_P: [int] new_death / tot_death 3.1.2 Inpatient Bed Occupation Some real numbers of counting need to be trasformed into the percentage for the use of studying the trends. For example, the number of inpatiend beds used for covid-19 will be transformed into the percetage in order to see if the inpatiend beds of the hospitals are overloaded due to covid-19. Raw values: inpatient_beds: [int] inpatient_beds_used: [int] inpatient_beds_used_covid: [int] Transformed values: inpatient_beds_used_P: [float] inpatient_beds_used/inpatient_beds inpatient_beds_used_covid_P: [float] inpatient_beds_used_covid/inpatient_beds 3.1.3 Previous Day Confirmed/Suspected Case for Adult &amp; Pediatric To study the differences between the impact on the adults and pediatrics from covid-19, we will split the data into two groups and study the changes of suspected/confirmed cases respectively in both groups. The impact of covid-19 on two groups might be different in different states so the average changes of two groups in US will be taken as the baseline to compare with the one of each state as well. Raw values: Adult: previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed: [int] previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected: [int] Pediatric: 1) previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed: [int] 2) previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected: [int] Transformed values: Adult: previous_day_admission_adult_covid_cases: [int] previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed + previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_P: [float] previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed / previous_day_admission_adult_covid_cases previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_P: [float] previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected / previous_day_admission_adult_covid_cases Pediatric: 1) previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_cases: [int] previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed + previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected 2) previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_P: [float] previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed / previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_cases 3) previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_P: [float] previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected / previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_cases ## date state new_case_P tot_death_P new_death_P inpatient_beds_used_P ## 1 2020-03-05 AK NaN NaN NaN NA ## 2 2020-03-05 AL NaN NaN NaN 0.2580645 ## 3 2020-03-05 AR NaN NaN NaN NA ## 4 2020-03-05 AZ 0.3333333 0.00000000 NaN 0.9800000 ## 5 2020-03-05 CA 0.2000000 0.02222222 1 0.3636364 ## 6 2020-03-05 CO 1.0000000 0.00000000 NaN NA ## inpatient_beds_used_covid_P previous_day_admission_adult_covid_cases ## 1 NA NA ## 2 0 NA ## 3 NA NA ## 4 0 NA ## 5 0 NA ## 6 NA NA ## previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_P ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA ## 5 NA ## 6 NA ## previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_P ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA ## 5 NA ## 6 NA ## previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_cases ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA ## 5 NA ## 6 NA ## previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_P.1 ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA ## 5 NA ## 6 NA ## previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_P ## 1 NA ## 2 NA ## 3 NA ## 4 NA ## 5 NA ## 6 NA 3.2 Nationwide data We group-by the data by date and summaries the counting values of some columns to investigate the trend of the nationwide situation. To study the trends of covid-19 over states and its impact on the hospital utilization, we have grouped-by the data by states and look into the situations changing along with time. Since the trends might be different due to the policies, population size and resources of each state, we will also be interested in how the differeces look like by comparing the trend of each state with the one of the whole country.

This plot provides a specific visualiation of the amount of missing data, showing in black the location of missing values, and also providing information on the overall percentage of missing values overall (in the legend), and in each variable. From this Most of missing values do not show by random, but they have patterns. An upset plot from the UpSetR package can be used to visualise the patterns of missingness, or rather the combinations of missingness across cases. To see combinations of missingness and intersections of missingness amongst variables, use the gg_miss_upset function: 6467 cases that those five columns have missing value together 152 adult_icu_bed_occupancy and adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization_NA "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Load Data 5.2 Compare death rates between two states in US (D3) 5.3 Total cases in US (static) 5.4 Total cases in US (static statebins)", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Load Data 5.2 Compare death rates between two states in US (D3) Compare two states 5.3 Total cases in US (static) 5.4 Total cases in US (static statebins) "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
