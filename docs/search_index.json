According to NYTimes, the total number of confirmed patients is about 17 million up to today. However, the development of Covid-19 in the United States is not monotonous, there are many changes from March to December. Facing the unprecedented pandemic, we would like to do have a clear understanding of the current circumstances of Covid-19 in our areas, the evolution of the number of new cases and death, the efficacy of Covid-19 protection policies. To learn these, exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques can be leveraged. In our project, our team want to make use of those toolkit we learned during the 5702 EDAV course, including tidyverse, ggplot2, d3, shiny, to conduct data analysis on the dataset about Covid-19, apart from giving audiences a general view of Covid-19 in the United States, in each state, we also focus on the study of the situation of the medical system (ICU, hospital beds), see the status of the medical system changes with time and with the evolution of the circumstance of Covid-19. Apart from analyzing the data itself, we also combine the pattern of data with the government policy and significant social events (stay at home order, shut down date, election day) to dive deeper into the root causes of the pattern. Our project report can be a useful reference for readers to know better about Covid-19, how Covid-19 has influenced our medical system, and what policies, which approaches are more helpful to control Covid-19. We elaborate the data by visualization tools to make the data readable and leveraged interactive tool d3 to build an interactive dashboard to help readers have a better experience with our analysis results. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Two Covid-19 datasets in csv format are collected (we searched dataset together and discussed to choose which to explore) from healthdata.gov. They are COVID-19 cases and deaths by States over time (Cases_and_Deaths) and COVID-19 patient impact and hospital capacity by State over time (Hospital_Utilization). We would combine two datasets for our use. Cases_and_Deaths has 18000 observations by 60 States from 2020-01-22 to 2020-11-16. Hospital_Utilization has 14003 observations by 53 States from 2020-01-01 to 2020-11-15. ## [1] &quot;Number of States in Cases_and_Deaths is 60.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Cases_and_Deaths records data from 2020-01-22 to 2020-11-16.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Number of States in Hospital_Utilization is 53.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Hospital_Utilization records data from 2020-01-01 to 2020-11-15.&quot; Two datasets are inconsistent in Date and States. To join them together, We chose the starting date at when the pandemic broke out (when total cases in US exceeded 100). And only focused on 50 States in “state” package. Covid19_df is the merged dataframe. ## [1] &quot;Covid-19 broke out among US at 2020-03-05.&quot; There are many useless variables for our analysis. We would drop all redundant variables.

Since COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases. There is much missing data, we will discuss the pattern of missing data in the Missing data chapter. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Percentage data 3.2 Nationwide data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Percentage data To investigate the trend in each state, it is necessary to study the change in the percentage of bed occupations and confired/suspected cases besides comparing the real numbers. Therefore, we transform the values of some columns into percentage. 3.1.1 Increase in covid-19 cases The relationship between the covid-19 cases and hospital utilization might be highly related. We are interested in how many of the suspected/confirmed cases are in each state. Therefore, we would transform the counts of newly increased cases into the percentage of admitted covid-19 cases among the total cases in each state. Raw values: tot_cases: [int] new_case: [int] tot_death: [int] new_death: [int] Transformed values: new_case_P: [float] new_case / tot_cases tot_death_P: [int] tot_death / tot_cases new_death_P: [int] new_death / tot_death 3.1.2 Inpatient Bed Occupation Some real numbers of counting need to be trasformed into the percentage for the use of studying the trends. For example, the number of inpatiend beds used for covid-19 will be transformed into the percetage in order to see if the inpatiend beds of the hospitals are overloaded due to covid-19. Raw values: inpatient_beds: [int] inpatient_beds_used: [int] inpatient_beds_used_covid: [int] Transformed values: inpatient_beds_used_P: [float] inpatient_beds_used/inpatient_beds inpatient_beds_used_covid_P: [float] inpatient_beds_used_covid/inpatient_beds 3.1.3 Previous Day Confirmed/Suspected Case for Adult &amp; Pediatric To study the differences between the impact on the adults and pediatrics from covid-19, we will split the data into two groups and study the changes of suspected/confirmed cases respectively in both groups. The impact of covid-19 on two groups might be different in different states so the average changes of two groups in US will be taken as the baseline to compare with the one of each state as well.

To study the trends of covid-19 over states and its impact on the hospital utilization, we have grouped-by the data by states and look into the situations changing along with time. Since the trends might be different due to the policies, population size and resources of each state, we will also be interested in how the differeces look like by comparing the trend of each state with the one of the whole country. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Number of Missing values for each variable 4.2 Patterns of Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this part, we do some study on the missing value of the dataset. Having better understanding of the missing value and dealing with missing values in feasible ways can help our analysis to be more accurate. First we can have a quick review of our dataset, we can see clearly that their are many missing values (NA entries) in our dataframe. 4.1 Number of Missing values for each variable x X 0 date 0 state 0 tot_cases 0 new_case 0 tot_death 0 new_death 0 hospital_onset_covid 276 inpatient_beds 201 inpatient_beds_used 275 inpatient_beds_used_covid 210 previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed 6073 previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected 6214 previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed 6478 previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected 6474 staffed_adult_icu_bed_occupancy 6485 staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_and_suspected_covid 6411 staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_covid 6261 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid 5936 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5811 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid 6476 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 6476 total_staffed_adult_icu_beds 6333 inpatient_beds_utilization 275 percent_of_inpatients_with_covid 298 inpatient_bed_covid_utilization 275 adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization 6644 adult_icu_bed_utilization 6637 From this table we can see clearly that there are 5 columns have about 200 missing values while 14 columns have more than 5,000 missing values. This plot provides a specific visualization of the amount of missing data, showing in black the location of missing values, and also providing information on the overall percentage of missing values overall (in the legend), and in each variable. From this graph we can see that most missing values happen together, they are not random missing values. After diving deeper into the data source, we know that the missing pattern is because states don’t always have consistent data collection methods over time. 4.2 Patterns of Missing values From the plot above, we can see more clear about the percentage of missing values in each variables. Upset plot of the dataset An upset plot from the UpSetR package can be used to visualize the patterns of missingness, or rather the combinations of missingness across cases. To see combinations of missingness and intersections of missingness amongst variables, use the gg_miss_upset function: * 6467 cases missing those five columns together; * 152 cases missing adult_icu_bed_occupancy and adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization_NA. What we need to note is that most missing values are from those five variables and they always show missing values together. This is what we need to consider in our following analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How does Covid19 spread by States over time? 5.2 How does medical resources affect Covid19 death rate? 5.3 Does Covid19 impact differently on adult and pediatric patients?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 How does Covid19 spread by States over time? 5.1.1 Total cases in US The plots above show the trend of total cases in US from March to November. At the very beginning, we find that the pandemic only exists in NY state (with few cases in other states). As time goes on, the Covid-19 cases spread rapidly through CA, TX and FL from June. From the nine plots above, it seems that the number of total cases in the east coast is higher than the one in the west and middle. 5.1.2 New cases in US The plots above show the trend of increased cases in US from March to November. In March, the break-out of Covid-19 occurred in NY and surrounding areas. After that, the second phrase of break-out occurred in CA, TX, FL and NY in July. After that, the cases of IL and the nearby regions also increased rapidly. 5.1.3 Monthly new cases (in thousands) by States This parallel coordinate plot captures monthly total new cases from March to November by States. Observing the outliers of each month, we could conclude that The situations of NY and NJ were most sever at the beginning of the epidemic, but the new cases were reduced a lot after May. From June to November, most new cases were confirmed in TX, FL and CA. The number of monthly new cases in IL has two obvious peaks in May and November respectively. 5.1.4 Ratio of new cases and total cases over time by States From this graph we can see that the 50 states have a similar pattern in the ratio of New case to Total case over time: very high at the beginning, and then be stable at a low level. It can be a signal that many confirmed patients have been recovered, also shows that Covid-19 control measures have been effective. 5.2 How does medical resources affect Covid19 death rate? 5.2.1 Death rate and Hospital admission rate This line chart displays average death rate and hospital admission rate of Covid-19 patients in the US. Because the hospital admission data before 2020-07-26 is missing, time of this plot starts from 2020-07-26. From the plot, we can see that overall hospital admission rate increased from 2020-09-28, and death rate not only decreased but also decreased faster. There are a lot of factors affect death rate, this plot shows that hospital admission rate is one of the factors. And this inspired us to explore the relationship between hospital admission rate and the change rate of death rate. 5.2.2 Decrease rate of death-rate and Hospital admission rate This is a smoothed plot of decrease rate of death rate and hospital admission rate. The pattern is very clear that when hospital admission rate decreases, death rate decreases slower. And when hospital admission rate increases, death rate decreases faster. We can conclude that enlarging the hospital capacity and receiving more Covid-19 patients could speed up the death rate decreasing. 5.2.3 Death rate and Inpatient bed availability This is a heatmap for available impatient beds and death rate. Because there is a delay for reporting death and death rate is more likely relating to number of available bed before death, we use the 7 days average value to see the relationship. It shows in the heapmap that Data with death rate higher than 10% has number of available inpatient beds less than 5000. When there are more than 15000 available inpatient beds, the death rate is below 5%. 5.2.4 Death rate and inpatient beds availability by States The Cleveland dot plot is about average number of monthly available inpatient beds in different States and facet by month. From this dot plot, we can clearly see that hospitals in most of the states increased inpatient beds from March to November. Compared to other states, FL, CA, TX and NY prepared more beds for Covid-19 patients. To see the relationship between death rate and inpatient beds availability, we draw this Cleveland dot plot of monthly average death rate in different States facet by months. Together with the inpatient bed availability plot, we found that those states who provide more inpatient beds like FL, CA, TX and NY, have relatively lower death rate. 5.3 Does Covid19 impact differently on adult and pediatric patients? 5.3.1 Comparison between adult and pediatric patients over time Month stat number 04 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 2 04 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 05 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5 05 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 06 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5 06 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 0 07 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 9779 07 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 73 08 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 8853 08 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 60 09 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 4263 09 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 44 10 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 5759 10 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 44 11 total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 7146 11 total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_covid 74 From this picture we can see clearly that from April to September, the percentage of children who and confirmed and hospitalized has different patterns between first three months and last four months. It is because first three most states didn’t distinguish adult and children. In the last four months, we can see that the percentage of children shows an increasing trend. But still, the number of children who infected Covid-19 is much more lower than that of adults. This is consistent with some research result that children are less likely to infect Covid-19 than adults. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Compare death rates between two states in US (D3)", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Compare death rates between two states in US (D3) Compare death rates of two states The interactive plot provides us with the funtionality to compare the trends of covid-19 death rates of two states or entire US. Since the number of states in US is large, it is hard to make comparisons between the trends of two states among fifty lines on the plot. Therefore, the interactive plot enables the user to choose two of the fifty states in US or entire US and plot the corresponding lines of death rates along with time, which could help the user understand the trends of differents states and US. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Using the data sources about COVID-19 cases in the US and hospital capacity &amp; COVID-19 patient impact, we gained insights about the trend of the pandemic in the US, the relationships between hospital capacity and death rates of COVID-19, differences between the impacts on adult &amp; pediatric patients. The interactive plot by d3 enables us to compare the trend of death rates in different states and the entire US. The work we have done is only the first step to get the whole picture of the pandemic in the US. The limitations and the future directions of our work are as follows: Although the trend of COVID-19 in the US is clearly shown in the plots, we only know little about the factors that affect on the situations. Given the COVID-19 cases &amp; death rates shown in all US states, we are curious about the impact of the population size, economic status, medical resources of different states on the change in the situation. Therefore, we would like to collect more data and compare the conditions of some states suffering effects to a different extent due to COVID-19. The relationships between the hospital capacity and death rates of COVID-19 inspire us about the importance of public medical resources. The spread-out of COVID-19 in the US leads to insufficiency of patient beds and other resources in many states. To help control the pandemic in the states with high death rates and rapidly increasing new cases, we could explore the differences between the health policies &amp; rules of these states and others in the future. In the plot of confirmed cases of adult &amp; pediatric patients, the difference in both groups’ impact is not so evident since the numbers of cases in both groups are incredibly imbalanced. Therefore, we will compare the growth rates and death rates in the two groups in the future. Besides, to get more insights into the impact of COVID-19 on people of different ages, we will find more data about the COVID-19 cases by age. The plots in the report help us learn more about the trend of COVID-19 in the US and its impact on the public. To study more about the pandemic in the US, we need more statistical tools to find out the factors that are crucial to the break-out COVID-19 cases in different states. "]]
