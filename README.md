This is a final project of Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class. 


We used the toolkit we learned during the 5702 EDAV course, including tidyverse, ggplot2, d3, shiny, to conduct data analysis on the dataset about Covid-19, apart from giving audiences a general view of covid-19 in the United States, in each state, we also focus on the study of the situation of the medical system (ICU, hospital beds), see the status of the medical system changes with time and with the evolution of the circumstance of Covid-19. Apart from analyzing the data itself, we also combine the pattern of data with the government policy and significant social events (stay at home order, shut down date, election day) to dive deeper into the root causes of the pattern.
